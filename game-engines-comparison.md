# 2D Platformer Game Engines Comparison (2026)

| Engine | Key Features | Pros | Cons | Best For | License | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------|------|----------|---------|------|
| **Godot 4.x** | GDScript/C#, scene system, built-in 2D physics, TileMap, AnimationTree, signals | Free & open source, lightweight (~40MB), excellent 2D-first design, active community, no royalties | Smaller ecosystem than Unity, fewer tutorials, less AAA adoption | Indie devs, hobbyists, 2D-focused projects, those avoiding royalties | MIT | Free |
| **Unity 2D** | Tilemap, 2D Physics, Sprite Shape, Universal Render Pipeline, Asset Store | Massive asset store, extensive documentation, industry standard, cross-platform | Runtime fee controversy, bloated for 2D, steeper learning curve | Professional studios, cross-platform releases, teams needing assets | Proprietary | Free tier / $185+/mo |
| **GameMaker** | Drag-and-drop + GML, room editor, built-in sprite editor, one-click export | Beginner-friendly, rapid prototyping, proven track record (Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter) | GML is niche, limited 3D, export costs add up | Beginners, solo devs, rapid prototyping, retro-style games | Proprietary | Free tier / $99-799 |
| **Defold** | Lua scripting, component-based, tiny runtime (~2MB), native extensions | Extremely lightweight, great mobile performance, free forever, no royalties | Smaller community, Lua-only, less visual tooling | Mobile games, HTML5 games, performance-critical projects | Custom (free) | Free |
| **Construct 3** | Visual scripting, browser-based, event sheets, instant preview | No coding required, fastest prototyping, runs anywhere with browser | Subscription-only, limited for complex games, less control | Non-programmers, educators, game jams, quick prototypes | Proprietary | $7-55/mo |

## Quick Recommendations

- **Total beginner?** → GameMaker or Construct 3
- **Indie dev wanting full control?** → Godot
- **Need massive asset library?** → Unity
- **Mobile-first or HTML5?** → Defold
- **Hate coding?** → Construct 3
