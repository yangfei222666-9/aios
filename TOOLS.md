# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## 应用路径
- QQ音乐 → E:\QQMusic\QQMusic.exe

## AIOS Dashboard
- **版本：** v3.4（默认使用）
- **路径：** C:\Users\A\.openclaw\workspace\aios\dashboard\AIOS-Dashboard-v3.4\
- **启动命令：** `cd C:\Users\A\.openclaw\workspace\aios\dashboard\AIOS-Dashboard-v3.4; & "C:\Program Files\Python312\python.exe" server.py`
- **访问地址：** http://127.0.0.1:8888

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

### TTS

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
